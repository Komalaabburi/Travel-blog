        <h2>Day 1: Exploring the River Walk</h2>
        <p>My adventure in San Antonio started with the iconic River Walk. I spent the day strolling along the beautiful pathways, lined with lush greenery and charming cafes. The serene waters and vibrant atmosphere made it a perfect start to my trip.</p>

        <p>One of the highlights of the River Walk was the boat tour, where I learned about the city’s history and enjoyed scenic views from the water. The mix of modern and historic architecture along the riverbanks was truly captivating.</p>

        <h2>Day 2: The Historic Alamo</h2>
        <p>The second day was filled with history. I visited the Alamo, the famous Spanish mission and the site of the 1836 Battle of the Alamo. Walking through the historic grounds and learning about the brave soldiers who fought there was a humbling experience.</p>

        <p>I spent hours exploring the museum exhibits and learning more about the Texan fight for independence. The Alamo stands as a symbol of resilience, and it was an unforgettable part of my trip.</p>

        <h2>Relaxing at Market Square</h2>
        <p>After an intense morning of history, I headed to Market Square for some relaxation and cultural experiences. Known as "El Mercado," it’s one of the largest Mexican markets outside of Mexico, filled with vibrant shops and delicious Tex-Mex food.</p>

        <p>I enjoyed some traditional food, picked up handmade souvenirs, and soaked in the lively atmosphere of this colorful market. The day ended on a high note, with music and dancing filling the streets.</p>
